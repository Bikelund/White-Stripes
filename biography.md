        <p class="bioTxt">Jack White was born John Anthony Gillis on 9th July 1975 into a musical, catholic family of 10 children in Detroit. He learned to play the guitar, drums and piano. He played in many bands growing up including The Go, Two Star Tabernacle. At 17 he was offered an apprenticeship at Muldoon Studio-an upholstery shop. During his time at Muldoon Studios, he formed a band with Brian Muldoon, the owner; they produced a 3-track single called The Upholsterers. Jack went on to have his own business, Third Man upholstery at about 21 years of age. Around this time he met Meg White, a bartender, and they married in 1996. </p></div>

        <p class="bioTxt">She is not the older sister of The White Stripes band mate Jack White, as we were originally led to believe. Rather, Megan Martha White, born in Detroit on December 10, 1974, is Jack Gillis White's former wife and current drummer. Meg's drumming style is unique in its simplicity, and Jack has often stated that this simplicity is essential to the White Stripes' childlike aesthetic. Meg has also acted as an occasional vocalist for the band, notably with the track "In the Cold, Cold Night" on the 2003 album "Elephant". Meg made her big screen debut with the Jim Jarmusch anthology Coffee and Cigarettes (2003).</p>
